I hold a B.S. and MSc. in Systems Engineering from the Universidad Industrial de Santander (UIS) in Bucaramanga, Colombia, and am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at the same institution. My research at UIS focuses on imaging inverse problems, mathematical optimization, and deep learning applications. My research interests include inverse problems, mathematical optimization, and deep learning.
